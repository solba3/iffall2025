      <h2>Why Memphis Still Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Though the Memphis Group disbanded in 1987 after just seven years, its impact on design culture has been
        nothing short of revolutionary. From fashion runways to tech startups, from museum collections to television
        sets, Memphis proved that "bad taste" could be brilliant—and that breaking the rules was sometimes the only
        way forward.

      <h2>Pop Culture Impact</h2>

        <div class="content-box yellow">
          <h3>Television + Media</h3>
          <p>
            Memphis aesthetics dominated 1980s and early 1990s visual culture. The iconic TV series Miami Vice
            showcased Memphis-inspired architecture and interiors, while Nickelodeon built their entire Double Dare
            set design around the movement's bold geometric patterns and electric colors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The style became synonymous with the decade itself—representing optimism, excess, and a rejection of
            minimalist restraint.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-box teal">
          <h3>Sports + Lifestyle</h3>
          <p>
            Surfing, skateboarding, skiing, and BMX companies rapidly adopted the Memphis aesthetic into their
            designs during the mid-1980s to early 1990s. The movement's energetic, youthful spirit aligned perfectly
            with extreme sports culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bright colors, geometric shapes, and chaotic patterns became the visual language of a generation seeking
            to push boundaries—both in design and in life.

          <h3>High Fashion</h3>
          <p>
            Memphis continues to inspire luxury fashion houses. Christian Dior's Fall/Winter 2011-2012 haute couture
            collection drew directly from Memphis principles, while Missoni's Winter 2015 collection celebrated the
            movement's bold patterns and colors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aesthetic proves that "kitsch" and "couture" aren't opposites—they're collaborators.

          <h3>Corporate Memphis</h3>
          <p>
            In the late 2010s, a "flat, geometric, figurative" illustration style became ubiquitous among tech
            startups and corporations. Wired Magazine dubbed it "Corporate Memphis" for its resemblance to the
            original movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though often criticized as sanitized, this style proves Memphis's lasting influence on how we visualize
            the digital world.

      <h2>Famous Collectors</h2>
      <div class="collector-card">
        <h3>Karl Lagerfeld</h3>
        <p>
          The legendary fashion designer was an avid collector of Memphis pieces, recognizing the movement's impact
          on contemporary aesthetics and its challenge to conventional notions of taste. Lagerfeld's appreciation
          helped legitimize Memphis in the eyes of the fashion and design elite.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="collector-card">
        <h3>David Bowie</h3>
        <p>
          Bowie was perhaps Memphis's most passionate celebrity collector. He described the experience of
          encountering Memphis furniture as visceral—a "jolt" and "impact" that was impossible to ignore,
          especially when the pieces first emerged in the early 1980s.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Bowie's death in 2016, part of his extensive Memphis collection was auctioned at Sotheby's,
          bringing renewed attention to the movement and confirming its status as collectible art.

    <div class="disbandment-section">
      <h2>The End of an Era</h2>
      <p>
        Ettore Sottsass left the Memphis Group in 1985 to focus on his design and architecture firm, Sottsass
        Associati. His departure marked the beginning of the end for the collective.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 1987, after just seven years of radical experimentation and rule-breaking, the Memphis Group officially
        disbanded. The members went their separate ways, pursuing individual careers and collaborations.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the brevity of Memphis's existence only amplified its impact. Like a brilliant supernova, it burned
        intensely and briefly—leaving behind a legacy that would influence design for decades to come.

      <h2>Lasting Influence</h2>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
          <p>
            Memphis proved that design doesn't have to be serious to be significant. It championed personality,
            humor, and emotional resonance over pure functionality—a philosophy that continues to challenge
            minimalist dogma today.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h3>Museum Collections</h3>
          <p>
            Major museums worldwide now house Memphis pieces as important artifacts of design history. The Victoria
            &amp; Albert Museum, Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art all feature
            Memphis works in their permanent collections.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h3>Contemporary Design</h3>
          <p>
            Former Memphis members like Nathalie Du Pasquier continue collaborating with contemporary brands (HAY,
            American Apparel), bringing the aesthetic to new generations. The Memphis spirit lives on in maximalist
            design movements and "dopamine decor" trends.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="influence-item">
          <h3>Cultural Conversations</h3>
          <p>
            Memphis sparked essential debates about taste, class, and the purpose of design that remain relevant
            today. It asked: Who decides what's "good design"? Can something be intentionally ugly yet beautiful?
            These questions continue to shape how we think about aesthetics.
