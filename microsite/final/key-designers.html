      <p>
        Memphis was a truly international collective, bringing together architects and designers from across the globe.
        Founded on December 6, 1980, when Ettore Sottsass invited a group of young designers and architects to discuss
        the future of design, the collective became a creative powerhouse that challenged every convention of modernism.
        Together, they produced over a hundred radical drawings in just three months, launching a movement that would
        redefine postmodern design.

      <h2>Founding Figures</h2>
      <div class="designer-card">
        <h3>Ettore Sottsass</h3>
        <span class="role">Founder + Leader</span>
        <p>
          The visionary founder and leader of the Memphis Group, Sottsass is now recognized as one of the most
          influential Italian post-war designers. His Carlton Room Divider and Casablanca Bookcase became iconic
          symbols of the movement. Sottsass left the group in 1985 to focus on his design and architecture firm,
          Sottsass Associati, but his impact on postmodern design remains unparalleled.

      <div class="designer-card">
        <h3>Martine Bedin</h3>
        <span class="role">Lighting Designer</span>
        <p>
          A French designer who joined Memphis in her twenties, Bedin was put in charge of overseeing all Memphis
          lighting production. Her father's engineering background and her own tendency for "playing with forbidden
          things" shaped her unique approach. Her Super lamp on wheels, first designed in 1978, represented
          "friend-like" objects—playful, approachable designs that brought warmth to the radical aesthetic.
          Her first prototype is now featured in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London.

      <div class="designer-card">
        <h3>Peter Shire</h3>
        <span class="role">Sculptor + Potter</span>
        <p>
          An American sculptor, designer, and potter from California, Shire was discovered through Wet: The Magazine
          of Gourmet Bathing, a west coast lifestyle publication. His irreverent attitude toward design conventions
          made him a perfect fit for Memphis.

      <div class="designer-card">
        <h3>Nathalie Du Pasquier</h3>
        <span class="role">Pattern Designer</span>
        <p>
          A French-born designer known for her bold Memphis-esque patterns, Du Pasquier continued the Memphis legacy
          long after the group disbanded in 1987. She has collaborated with contemporary brands including Danish
          company HAY (designing patterned bags in 2013) and American Apparel, bringing the Memphis aesthetic to
          new generations of design enthusiasts.
