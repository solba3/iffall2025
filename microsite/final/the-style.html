    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <div class="principles">
      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>Radical Color</h3>
        <p>Memphis rejected the muted, neutral palettes of modernism in favor of explosive, clashing colors. Hot pinks, electric blues, sunny yellows, and vibrant teals collided in ways that were deliberately jarring and joyful. Color wasn't just decorative—it was rebellious.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>Geometric Shapes</h3>
        <p>Circles, triangles, squiggles, and zigzags became the visual vocabulary of Memphis. These shapes were often arbitrary and non-functional, added purely for aesthetic impact. The geometry was playful, abstract, and unapologetically decorative.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>"Cheap" Materials</h3>
        <p>Memphis embraced plastic laminates, terrazzo, and mass-produced materials that modernists had scorned. They celebrated the artificial and the synthetic, finding beauty in what had been considered low-brow or kitsch. This was design for the real world, not the elite.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <h3>Bold Patterns</h3>
        <p>Stripes, dots, squiggles, and abstract motifs covered every surface. Patterns weren't meant to harmonize—they clashed, overlapped, and competed for attention. The result was visually chaotic but undeniably energetic and alive.</p>
