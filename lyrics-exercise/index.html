            <p>You say we're fine, but your brown eyes</p>
            <p>Are green this time, so you've been crying</p>
            <p>It's in the way you say my name</p>

            <p>Got way too drunk off a vodka cranberry</p>
            <p>Called you up in the middle of the night</p>
            <p>Wailing like an imbecile</p>
            <p>If you won't end things, then I will</p>
