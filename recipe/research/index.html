      After three years of baking, I’ve finally discovered the techniques and ways to bake a fool-proof Japanese soufflé cheesecake that has a beautiful top, will not crack while baking and rising, and will not deflate (much at least) after removal from the oven! Japanese soufflé cheesecake is also known as Japanese cotton cheesecake or just Japanese cheesecake. It is airy, fluffy, and less dense than cheesecakes.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Separate the eggs: yolks in one bowl, whites in another.</li>
      <li>Melt butter, cream cheese, and ¼ cup sugar over low heat until smooth.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat, add the egg yolks, mix gently.</li>
      <li>Add cornstarch and flour; mix until no lumps remain.</li>
      <li>Add milk and optional flavorings; mix well.</li>
      <li>Beat egg whites into stiff peaks (with cream of tartar).</li>
      <li>Gently fold some egg whites into the cake batter, then fold in the rest in batches.</li>
      <li>Pre-heat oven to 330°F. Prepare a bain-marie (water bath).</li>
      <li>Line baking pans with parchment paper on bottom and sides.</li>
      <li>Pour batter into prepared pans.</li>
      <li>Bake in the bain-marie for 25 minutes at 330°F. Once the cake has risen, crack the oven door slightly (~10 seconds), reduce temperature to 245-265°F, bake for additional 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>After baking, let cake rest in the oven ~10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove from oven. Flip carefully (using parchment and plate) for presentation.</li>
      <li>Serve warm or chill as preferred.</li>
    </ol>

  <section id="notes">
    <h2>Notes & Troubleshooting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If the cake cracks: perhaps the oven was too hot. You can decorate over the crack if needed.</li>
      <li>If top is airy/fluffy but bottom is dense: possibly not enough folding of the egg whites.</li>
      <li>If it doesn’t rise: maybe the egg whites weren’t stiff enough, or temperature wasn’t high enough, or over-mixing happened.</li>
      <li>For gluten-free version, substitute flour with sweet rice flour (Mochiko).</li>
    </ul>
