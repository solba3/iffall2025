                This class is required for the ComDes BFA track, 
                but I've also been interested in UI/UX and learning about front-end development through that field.
            </li>
            <li>Yes, I've learned some at home, and I've also taken the Web Development CSE class.</li>
            <li>
                I hope to learn a little more about how I can integrate coding as I develop more interaction 
                design skills.

                I know that designing for the screen has a lot more considerations with how the user expects to interact 
                with its components. There are also things to consider with how the user resizes their browser window, or how
                large their screen is in the first place.

                I think that <a href="www.cosmos.so">Cosmos</a> exemplifies very effective design. It's extremely minimal, focusing on the
                primary purpose of looking for images without the cognitive overload of Pinterest's peppered-in advertisements and captions.

            <li>
                <a href="nasa.gov">NASA</a> does a good job at communicating. It has a lot of information just in its landing page, but
                it's all organized in a manner that makes everything clear in hierarchy and cohesive in what kind of information
                the user might be looking for. 
            </li>

                The <a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods</a> website is pretty effective in my opinion.
                Its landing page takes you directly to sales and its unique services (such as catering and delivering groceries),
                but the first option in the navigation bar is to browse its in-store products, which predicts what many users
                would be interested in. The search bar also has a text field that prompts the user to search for specific products.
                It also organizes its products by both categories and dietary preferences, simplifying what other would have been
                extra work filtering.
